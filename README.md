## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction
Hi guys... This repo is used to automatically count your juggling using an amazing deep learning computer vision state-of-the-art (SOTA) method called YOLOv8. I use some features of YOLOv8 such as Object Detection, Object Tracking, and Pose Detection. Please read my article below on Linked In for more information about step-by-step how to count juggles using YOLOv8.
